DESCRIPTION
The task \fBwfpfind\fR is used as the standard IRAF daofind task to find
stars on ccd images. The main difference is that the present task works on a
mosaic image. The user can specify whether he/she wants to use the complete mosaic
or only one ccd. The use of a list of ccd will be implemented in the future.
To use the task, you need to specify the name of the image to be searched for and
the number of the required ccd (or the keyword "all"). 
The output catalog can be either in wcs or logical coordinatesm.
The finding algorithm can be tuned by means of the seeing and the threshold parameters.
