NAME
wfpdcat -- search via WEB the USNO catalog (ESO) to obtain star
position catalogs.
.ih
USAGE
wfpdcat image1, image2,... cat1, cat2,..
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls image
Images for which you need star catalogs.
.le
.ls names
Names of corresponding catalogs. You need to specify one catalog for each image. If you set this parameter to \fBdefault\fR, a template name will be produced in the form \fBimage_root_name.cat\fR, which is the same default used in the task wfpdzero.
.le
.ls maxob
Maximum number of objects in catalogs. If you set this option to a
value smaller than the USNO stars in the field, the faintest stars are 
eliminated.
.le
.ls radius
Maximum distance of an object from the header coordinates of the
center of the field.
.le

DESCRIPTION
This task is used to produce star catalogs for the task
\fBwfpdzero\fR. For each image on the input list, the image header
keywords \fBRA\fR and \fBDEC\fR are read and the USNO catalog is
searched. The maximun number of stars for each catalog is set by the
parameter \fBmaxob\fR while the maximum search radius is determined by 
the parameter \fBradius\fR. If the USNO catalog contains more stars
than required, only the brightest are included in the output
catalog. The name of the output catalog may be specified in two ways:
either you provide a valid catalog name for each image, or you set the 
\fBname\fR parameter to "default". In this case, a catalog name will
be produced in the form ima0001.cat for image ima0001.fits. The
catalog name is written to image header in the keyword \fBCATALOG\fR
of the extension "0".

EXAMPLES
1. If you want to generate catalogs for each image in current
directory without bothering about catalog names:

	cl> wfpdcat *.fits names="default" maxob=1000 radius=30

This example is based on the assunption that you are using the
WFI@2p2.
These catalogs can be used by the task wfpdzero in this way:

	cl> wfpdzero *.fits header+ 

2. You want another set of catalogs for the same images, but with a
smaller radius.

	cl> wfpdcat *.fits small1, small2, ..., small5 maxob=100
radius=20

if you want to use these catalogs, you will have to issue the command:

	cl> wfpdzero *.fits header+

if the headers are correct, or

	cl> wfpdzero *.fits small1, small2, ... , small5 header-

if you used wfpdcat for other purposes on the same images.
